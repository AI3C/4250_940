E00551236 10/3/2022:I chose requirements because I thought that was what I knew the least about out of the 3 topics.                 
I prepared by looking back at the required and optional reading as well doing some research on the topic for another perspective, then I typed out all of the main points I wanted to get across based off of what I thouhgt was imprtant.

E00707581: I chose design because It is my favorite stage, I enjoy designing. I prepared for presenting this by going back to the class readings, and familiarizing myself with the important key concepts. I then designed bulleted notecards to help as I talk through the concepts of design.

E00490237: 10/3/2022   I chose to cover Implementation, the reason being is that I felt like I had a better understanding of the material compared to the other two topics.
I prepared by reading the material and taking notes of the high points id like to cover and then organized them into a brief presentation.

E00574211:  Topic for Presentation: Requirements
            Reason I chose the topic: I felt the most confident in my ability to present on this topic
            How I prepared: I went through the reading for Requirements, typed the information in my own words to review beforehand, 
            then made a bulletpoint list of things to cover to look at during the presentation if I need a reminder

E00501244: Design
I chose Design because it seemed interesting to learn how the steps of design are taken, getting into smaller parts of the requirements as more people work with each step.
I read the slides with the presenter's notes along with the website for design patterns, taking notes on what would be good to use in the speech.

E00607328: 
-I chose Requirements. 
-I thought this section was the most interesting to me and found it fascinating how much preparation there is in building requirements for a solution.
-I spend time going back through the slides and created a document on the order I would talk about the parts of the requirement analysis and prepared and practiced giving my presentation.
