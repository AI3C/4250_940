  Resolution of program should size to take up half of the user's first monitor
  The program should have a 2d "surface" for the ball to travel filling the program window
  The program should have a ball starting in the middle of the screen
  The ball should be visualized as a circle with radius of 5 pixels and its collision area should be treated as its visualization
  The ball should have a starting velocity of 10 pixels per second, moving in a random direction
  The edges of the screen should be treated as obstacles
  Allow the user to draw obstacles using their mouse
  The ball should ignore drawings smaller than 3 connected pixels
  If a pixel is later attached to a collection of pixels, the game understands they are connected and will treat it as an obstacle if it is 3 or more pixels
  If two existing collections of pixels are connected by the user, the game understands they are connected and will treat it as an obstacle if it is 3 or more pixels
  The program should appropriately handle mice of different DPIs for drawing the obstacles
  The ball should travel the opposite direction at the same speed if encountering a perpendicular obstacle
  The ball should handle dealing with angled surfaces the user draws by calculating the appropriate direction the ball should travel based on the collision and sending the ball that direction
  The ball should temporarily ignore obstacles that are being drawn directly over the ball's current position -- avoiding unknown behavior
  The program should not be resizable -- avoiding unnecessary complexity
