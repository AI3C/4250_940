WCK- Overall, very good job. The point of the exercise was to think the problem out before coding it. To take time to understand the requirements 
by doing a design, to define test cases and test data, etc. You did most of that. AND you caught the test case I normally trip people up with (see bottom of file)

    Do you count spaces as a character? If I pass your document into itself when running, would it process "WCK-" or the whole thing or just up to the carriage return?
    Is counting spaces included in the requirements? That is to say, what do I mean when I say "a string".

        Design:

        Take in a string(from a user or a file), compute the total number of
        occurrences of each character in the ASCII set. Print out the top three characters
        (with the most occurrences). Print out how many characters in the ASCII set you didnâ€™t detect.
        Then print out the string in reverse order.
 
        1. Take a string from the user
        2. Turn every character of string into an arraylist
        3. Handle the arraylist to display 3 statements

        Display 3 print statements:
            - Top 3 occuring strings
            - How many ASCII characters were not in the string
            - Print the string in reverse order

         - Definition of Done -
        With the problem given to me, I have created a design/plan to complete it.
        After the design was completed, I prepared the code with class and object structures.
        To start the coding process, I set up the user input to prepare for the 3 seperate print statements.
        I handled the user input to prepare for any unwanted inputs.
        I documented all blocks of code and any lines that needed aditional information.
        Although in the environment I worked in couldn't be tested, I went through the code to ensure accuracy.
        Therefore I believe the implementation of this problem is complete with the time allocated to me.
