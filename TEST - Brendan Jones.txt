Tests for Battleship Game:

Missile Behavior:
	Press spacebar once:
		Expected Behavior: one missile is launched.
		Requirements Addressed:
			Pressing spacebar should initiate missile launch
	Press right mouse button once:
		Expected Behavior: one missile is launched
		Requirements Addressed:
			Pressing right mouse button should initiate missile launch
	Press spacebar and/or right mouse button 6 times in rapid succession
		Expected Behavior: five missiles are launched.
		Requirements Addressed:
			Pressing spacebar should initiate missile launch
			No more than five active missiles are allowed at once
	Launch a missile, then wait for it to go off screen, then launch five more in rapid succession:
		Expected Behavior: One missile should be launched, then become inactive after leaving the screen, then five more missiles should be launched
		Requirements Addressed: 
			Solution must remove a missile from being active when it goes off screen
	Press each non-assigned button once:
		Expected Behavior: nothing should happen
		Requirements Addressed:
			Right mouse button and spacebar should initiate missile launch
	During all other Missile Behavior tests, observe missile speed, launch location, launch direction:
		Expected Behavior: Missiles should appear from the center of the bottom of the screen, traveling straight upwards at a constant speed.
		Requirements Addressed:
			The solution must maintain the same constant speed for all missiles
			The solution must launch missiles from the center of the bottom of the screen when a launch is initiated
			The solution must maintain the same constant direction for all missiles to be vertically straight up from the launched position.

Ship Behavior:
	Run Game at default configuration settings:
		Expected Behavior:
			A ship should be launched immediately if no ship is on the screen
			Multiple types of ship should be present, with different images used for different ships
			The ships should move at the rates assigned for their ship type
			New ships should be launched at a random interval, unless the limit is reached
			There should never be more than ten ships on screen at once
			There should be a roughly equal number of ships launched accross each type
			Ships should be launched at random from any row in the uper two thirds of the screen
			Ships should be launched from the sides of the screen
			Ships should be launched either from right to left or left to right
			Ships should no longer be active once they leave the screen
		Requirements Addressed
			The solution must initiate a ship launch when the system detects there are no active ships.
			The solution must support multiple types of ships based on a configurable value.
			The solution must display the appropriate image based on the type of ship when the ship is active
			The solution must randomly initiate a ship launch based on a configurable rate where the default is 30% of the time
			The solution must randomly choose from available ship types when a launch is initiated, giving all types equal chance of being launched.
			The solution must limit the number of active ships on the screen to no more than ten (10) at any given time. (an “active ship ” is any ship currently being displayed on the screen)
			The solution must randomly choose a location to launch a ship from when initiated
			The system must randomly choose to launch the ship from the left side of the screen or the right side of the screen
			The system must randomly choose a row in the top two-thirds of the screen to launch the ship from
			The system must assign the speed of the ship based on the type of the ship being initiated
			The system must assign the direction of the ship based on which side of the screen it is being launched from (if from the left, direction goes left to right; if from the right, direction goes right to left)
			The solution must remove the ship from being active if it goes off the screen.
	Run Game at lowest configuration values:
		Expected Behavior: 
			Ship types should reflect configuration value
			Ship launch rate should be low
		Requirements Addressed:
			The solution must support multiple types of ships based on a configurable value.
			The solution must randomly initiate a ship launch based on a configurable rate where the default is 30% of the time
	Run Game at highest configuration value:
		Expected Behavior:
			All ship types should appear
			Ship launch should be rapid
			Only 10 ships should appear on screen
			Program should not close unexpectedly
		Requirements Addressed: 
			The solution must support multiple types of ships based on a configurable value.
			The solution must randomly initiate a ship launch based on a configurable rate where the default is 30% of the time
			The solution must limit the number of active ships on the screen to no more than ten (10) at any given time. (an “active ship ” is any ship currently being displayed on the screen)
	
Ship-Missile Collision Behavior:
	Observe: Collision Counter:
		Expected Behavior: A collision counter should be displayed on the screen.
		Requirements Addressed: 
			The solution must keep a count of all “hits”
	Fire missiles at ships on the screen until one "hits" a ship:
		Expected Behavior: When a missile collides with a ship, an explosion animation should be played briefly at the point of impact, then the missile, ship, and animation should disappear from the screen. The collision counter should then increase by one.
		Requirements Addressed:
			The solution must detect when a missile “hits” a ship
			The solution must display an explosion at the point where a missile “hits” a ship
			The solution must remove the missile and ship after the missile “hits” the ship
			The solution must keep a count of all “hits”
	
Game End Behavior:
	Press left mouse button:
		Expected Behavior: game should close:
		Requirements Addressed: 
			The solution must end the game when the user clicks the left mouse button
	Press the ESC key:
		Expected Behavior: game should close
		Requirements Addressed:
			The solution must end the game when the user clicks the esc button
	Play the game normally, until "hitting" 10 ships:
		Expected Behavior: game should close
		Requirements Addressed: 
			The solution must end the game when the “hit” count has reached ten (10)
	Leave the game open for five consecutive minutes with zero input:
		Expected Behavior: game should close:
		Requirements Addressed: 
			The solution must end the game if the user has not initiated a missile launch in the last 5 minutes.
