Test team Britney

Overall, good job.
Need to have traceability back to which requirements you are testing for. (is that what the numbers are in front of the names?? I initially thought it was the number of the test).
Could use more error testing;
What happens if the screen is resized in the middle of the game (do missiles still shoot from the new middle; did the ships dissapear or not make it to the new end of the screen)
Changing config values to boundaries (0%, 100%) or beyond or to invalid entries

1-9 
you have key elements of a test case; steps to run and expected results. Good.

I like the one about holding the space bar down 
I like the one after that; space bar and right click at the same time. Unique. I haven't seen that one yet.

11-14 
"in the same box"?? 
Can a missile hit more than one ship? What if the ships are overlapped on the screen at the time of impact?

16-20 and 21-24
Need to state these in the form of steps to execute followed by an expected outcome.
For example: Change the configuration rate to 100% and verify that a maximum of 10 Ships appear on the screen. 
CHange the configuration rate to 0% and verify at most one ship appears (because of the requirement that a ship
is launched whenever there are no ships on the screen).
etc.

25-28
How can someone do the first bullet?
for the second, is the speed based on size? 
You could change the config values to have only one kind of ship, set the image, verify it displays, 
then change the image and verify the new one displays
Don't just restate the requirement, think of steps to take to verify the requirement

What happened to number 29???

30-33
These seem ok. 
What if the user holds down the left mouse and then moves the cursor off the screen. Should the game end?
