WCK - need a traceability back to the requirement for each test. To ensure all requirements are covered.
The test cases should be in the form of a series of steps to be execute followed by the expected result.
You are close. But these are too general and are closer to a paraphrase of the requirement.
See Brandon Jones' test cases submission.


1. Test to see if you can launch a missile, and make sure it is done with the right click and spacebar only.
2. Test to see if you can have five missiles out at a time, and that they are dissapearing correctly (On hit, when you fire a sixth missile, or when they fly off screen)
3. Test to see if the missile launch is correct (Consistent speed, launch from the correct place, maintain direction)

4. Test missiles hitting a ship (Explosion is displayed, missile and ship are gone, hit counter goes up)

5. Test that ships are launching properly, and that they are launching once no ships are present.
6. Test that there are multiple types of ships present, that there are equal amountsof them, and that they look/move correctly.
7. Test that the ships are spawning often enough.
8. Test that there are not more than 10 ships on the screen at a time.
9. Test that the ships come from both the left and the right sides randomly, as well as the top two-thirds of the screen.
10. Test that the ships are removed after they go off screen

11. Test that the game ends once the player has gotten 10 hits.
12. Test that the user can exit the game on left click, or escape.
